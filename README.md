## Project Overview

This dissertation investigates the relationship between financial news sentiment and the daily price volatility of two exchange-traded funds (ETFs): the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), representing a niche renewable energy sector, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), representing the broader market.

The artefact demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP), econometric modeling, and quantitative backtesting can be combined into a **reproducible, end-to-end pipeline** to assess sentiment-volatility interactions and evaluate sentiment-driven trading strategies.

## Dissertation Objectives

1. **Extract and quantify** financial sentiment from news articles using VADER and FinBERT models
2. **Model and compare** ETF volatility using realized volatility and GARCH(1,1)
3. **Evaluate** the correlation and predictive relationship between sentiment and volatility
4. **Design and backtest** rules-based trading strategies informed by sentiment signals
5. **Compare outcomes** between TAN (sector-specific) and SPY (broad market)
